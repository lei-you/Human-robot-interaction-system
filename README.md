# Human-robot-interaction-system

## Objective
We are trying to develop a vision-based human-robot interaction system which is deployed in an embedding platform.
## Details
The system consists of skin detection, hand localization, hand tracking and guesture recognistion. In order to make the recognition process run in real-time, the proposed method is based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) which not only helps to build the skin model but also helps to classify the gestures. An embedded system with our algorithm is almost the same with a PC(Intel Core i3 500, 4G DDR3) real-time performance. At the same time, the average recognition rate is more than 75%. Both the embedded system and the real time hand gesture recognition algorithm is used to control an intelligent robot.
